## How It Works

1. **Chat Monitoring**: Nozmie listens to your configured chat channels and analyzes messages for keywords matching known spells and items.
2. **Keyword Matching**: Uses intelligent whole-word detection to find exact matches (e.g., searching for "portal" won't match "portable").
3. **Availability Check**: Verifies that you own the spell, item, or toy before displaying it in the banner or utility page.
4. **Banner Display**: Shows a classic WoW-style dialog banner with the matched option(s) and their icons.
5. **One-Click Action**: Click the banner or utility page item to instantly cast the spell or use the item.

## Notes & Tips

- **Only your spells/items are shown**: The addon only displays actions you can actually perform (owned spells, items, or toys).
- **Whole-word matching**: Prevents false positives; "portal" will not match "portable" or "portalstone".
- **Stacking**: If multiple actions match a single message, they'll all be displayed in a stacked banner format.
- **Instance-specific suppression**: Use instance filters to hide unwanted categories in dungeons/raids while keeping them visible in open world.
- **Cooldown-aware**: Icons fade or display cooldown timers when spells are on cooldown.
- **Position persistence**: Banner position is saved between sessions.

## Future improvements
- Nozmie may not detect localized dungeon names for now, but its in the radar.
